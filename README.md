# GeeseSpotter 

**Author:** Insaf Lashari  
**Date:** November 10, 2023

A command-line logic game inspired by Minesweeper ‚Äî but with geese instead of mines! The objective is to reveal all safe fields on the board without disturbing a goose.

## üïπ Gameplay Overview

- The player is presented with a board where all fields are initially hidden (`*`).
- Each turn, the player can choose one of the following actions:
  - **[S]how**: Reveal a field
  - **[M]ark**: Mark or unmark a field suspected of containing a goose
  - **[R]estart**: Start a new game with fresh parameters
  - **[Q]uit**: Exit the game

## Game Rules

- If the player **reveals a goose**, the game ends in defeat.
- If the player **reveals a safe field**:
  - The field is shown.
  - If the field and its neighbors contain no geese, neighboring fields are also automatically revealed.
  - Each revealed field displays a number from 0‚Äì8 representing how many adjacent geese are nearby.
- **Marking/Unmarking**:
  - A hidden field can be marked as suspected of containing a goose.
  - A marked field can be unmarked to return it to the hidden state.
  - Only hidden fields can be revealed or marked.
- The game is **won** when all non-goose fields are successfully revealed.
